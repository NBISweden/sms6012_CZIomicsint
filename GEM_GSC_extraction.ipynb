    "This notebook demonstrates the process of extracting gene-metabolite and gene-subsystem associations from Human-GEM, and exporting them to a `.gmt` file (a common file format for gene set collections).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is not required that you run this notebook, since the resulting files `HumanGEM_metabolite_GSC.gmt` and `HumanGEM_subsystem_GSC.gmt` already exist in the `data/gene_set_collections/` subdirectory of this session (these files are needed for the next exercise in R). However, we have provided the code here so it is clear how one would generate such files from a GEM if necessary.\n"

This can be done in one of two ways, since GEMs treat metabolites as different if they are in different compartments, even if they are chemically identical. For example, `ATP_c` and `ATP_m` are both adenosine triphosphate, but one metabolite represents ATP in the cytoplasm, and the other represents ATP in the mitochondria.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can therefore include the compartment information in the metabolite-gene associations, such that `ATP_c` and `ATP_m` will be separate gene sets. However, since many of these metabolites participate in similar reactions (encoded by the same genes) and/or because metabolite gene sets can already be quite small, it is often recommended that the compartment is ignored, and all compartment forms of a metabolite are merged together."
